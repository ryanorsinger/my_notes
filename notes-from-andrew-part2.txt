Notes from Andrew

Takeaways
- Put my thesis up front
- Add more POP!
- Add more transitions and verbal signposts
- Overload transitions and never too many Sign-posts
- Continue to restraining myself from giving the footnotes and branching details
- Avoid slowing down and overelaborating things.. to provide extra analogies and even different metaphores. I should avoid saying the same thing in a different way... with different examples.. because that .. slows down my rate of speach.
- CLIP  IT  WHEN It's done and ready to move on!
- OK, let's move on!

1. Be more clipped and to the point.
Still too much slowing down of the rate of speech and it's related to the footnoting style.
Don't over elaborate things that I've already explained.
"Let's move to the next exercise"
"OK, we're moving on..."

2. Try to verbalize even more specific transitions.
- "OK, we just did XYZ. "
- "OK, I just demonstrated XYZ off the cuff. Let's do an XYZ together now."
- "OK, we just "

3. Sometimes in group meetings, I'm going on digressions.

4. Be conscious of all of these things in group meetings as well!
