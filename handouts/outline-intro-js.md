Agenda
- Give time for them to finish the string exercise
- Any review
- HEADS UP - STAY FROSTY about this stuff
	- Make sure they know that = means assignment and only assignment.
	- Demo 2=2 and “something” = “something”
	- Demo ‘$’ + ‘4’ + 2 vs. ’$’ + parseInt('4') + 2
- Console demo true AND false vs true OR false
- Demo `var hereNow = true` `var currentlyOnTheMoon = false`
- Inline JS vs External JS lesson and Exercise
- Intro the If/Else lesson material and explain the (condition) part of it
- Demo
	if (true) {
	   console.log("Hi!");
	}
	if (true) {
	   console.log("It's me, again!");
	}
	
	if(hereNow) {
 	    console.log(“Hello, Codeup! I’m here right now and we’re doing JavaScript!”;
	}

        if(currentlyOnTheMoon) {
	    console.log(“I’m currently on the moon. How deathly and boring!”);
	} else {
	    console.log(“I aint on the moon”);
	}

	if(currentlyOnTheMoon) {
	   console.log(“I’m on the moon”);
	} else if (null) {
	   console.log(“How did that happen?”);
	} else {
	   console.log(“I a neither on the moon nor am I null”);
	}

- Comparison operator demo  ‘2’ == 2 vs. ‘2’ === 2	
- Give them time for the If/Else exercises
- Switch lesson and exercise, give them enough time
- Get volunteers for the stand up while loop  exercise = while(i<5){}
- Then do the Do - While do { stuff } while(i < 5);
- With folks still standing, remove my volunteer with the iterator for an infinite loop
- For loop lesson and exercise
- BONUS is FizzBuzz, yo!
