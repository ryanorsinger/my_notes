Variables hold values. Values have a data type. JS attempts to determine the data type of variables automatically.

We declare variables in javascript with the `var` keyword. As a convention, we name things with "camelCase".
`var myFirstVariable = "Hello, Codeup!";` creates a new variable and assigns it a value, the string.
Now type `typeof myFirstVariable;`.
`myFirstVariable = 42;` reassigns the value that the variable will now hold.

Example showing the difference between `true || false` and `true && false` is that any TRUE in an OR spreads the truth while any FALSE within an AND operation spreads the FALSE.

The entire statement "I'm right here now OR I'm currently under the sea in a submarine." is true. It makes sense.

"I'm right here now AND I'm currently standing on the bottom of the ocean floor." is a false statement.
