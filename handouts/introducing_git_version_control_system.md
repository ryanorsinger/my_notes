## Codeup, Using Git for Version Control, 2015-06-15, Version Control Systems:
A common way to manage the versions of your files and  content is to name files with increasing levels of description.
Example: `Resume.pdf`, `Resume_Final.pdf`,  `Resume_Final_Monday.pdf`, `Resume_FINAL_to_print.pdf`, and `Resume_print_before_interview.pdf`
vs. a permanent record with a time machine that can enter paralell dimensions

## Git, the Big Picture
Git allows us to version our files and their contents by allowing us to take snapshots called commits. Our filenames remain the same and the history of commits creates a permanent record for our code and contents that have been in that file. 

- Git commands may only be run in a directory we have initialized as a git repository.
- We issue git commands through the command line or a GUI (Graphical User Interface) program. 
- Each time we make a new commit, git adds 
### Git works by connecting two repositories together. 

**Local** - Local repositories are regular directories on your Mac that have been initialized with the `git init` command. 

**Remote** - Remote repositories are the online places where we're saving our code so we don't lose it. They're like dropbox or google drive, but for code and they talk git. 


Git Workflow - real exercises together, yay!
