# Chapter 5, Formatting
## Formatting is about communication

Formatting is important. Our code's formatting creates the first impression for all of our code.

We format our code in order to present neatness, consistency, and attention to detail. Attention to detail communicates competency.

** Formatting is about communication. **

** Communication is the professional developer's first priority. **

All previous chapters of *Clean Code* speak to code quality, clarity, meaning and intention. Each chapter so far has focused on elements of effective communication through your code. We don't write code for computers. If that was true, we would write only binary. Our code is written primarily for human understanding and communication. 

* The only valid measurement of code quality is the number of WTFs per minute 
* Intention revealing, meaningful, clear names for classes, functions, and variables

## Ok, formatting is important. I get it. Now what?

    - Choose a set of simple formatting rules. 
    - Consistently apply them across all projects
    - Teams should agree to a simple set of rules and then apply them consistently.
    - Consider applying automated tools to help with format consistency (Git hooks, editor linters)


## Vertical formatting
   - Small files are usually easier to understand than large files
   - "Functions should be 5 lines or less"
   - Use the newspaper metaphore: details increase as we move downward
   - Vertical openness between concepts is important

## Horizontal formatting
    - Indentation
